## [2026-02-06 11:00] Calendar Integration
- Task: Integrate a calendar into the To-Do feature.
- Strategy: Add `scheduledDate` to `TaskItem`. Refactor `TaskListView` to include a `DatePicker` and a subview `DailyTaskList` that queries tasks for the selected date.

## [2026-02-06 11:30] Project Cleanup & Archival
- Task: Declutter the project root and source directory.
- Strategy: Created an `Archive/` folder and moved redundant/historical files (`Item.swift`, `restore_point.md`, `mark.md`) there.
- Note: These files are now excluded from standard context and will only be accessed if explicitly requested.
